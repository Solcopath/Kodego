                    <p><i>An open playground for small wars of position and attrition divide two sites on Ascent. Each
                            site can be fortified by irreversible bomb doors; once they’re down, you’ll have to destroy
                            them or find another way. Yield as little territory as possible.</i></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ascent is a map set in Italy that features a large, open middle area that both teams can skirmish
                        over. Mid is a playground for diverse ability use and successfully controlling the area opens
                        additional routes for Attackers to both Spike sites.</p>
                    <p>The map's 'unique' features include mechanical doors leading into sites. Each site has one door
                        (A Link for A and Market for B) that is opened at the start of each round. Players can use a
                        switch on the site side of the door (Next to the door on A and on a table in Toolshed on B) to
                        close or open the door. These doors are impenetrable while closed but have 500 HP, allowing
                        players to damage and eventually destroy them. Once destroyed, the doorway remains permanently
                        open for the rest of the round.</p>
                    <p>The two walls separating Courtyard from Link also have a destructible panel each to cover them.
                        Whilst intact, they absorb damage and cannot be penetrated by gunfire. The panels however have
                        400 HP each and can be damaged, with colored indicators on them implying how much health they
                        have left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as they take more damage). They can
                        eventually be destroyed to allow players to wallbang through these walls for the rest of the
                        round.</p>

                                    the VALORANT Protocol failing to stop them, the resulting explosion triggered a
                                    cataclysmic event, ripping a huge chunk of the city out of the ground. Now
                                    permanently suspended hundreds of meters in the sky, this airborne island remains as
                                    a product of the most destructive radianite-related event known to Alpha.</h6>

                    <p>Bind's 'unique' feature is that it doesn't contain a mid section, instead having two one-way
                        teleporters. One takes players from A Short to B Short and the other takes players from B Long
                        to A Lobby.</p>
                    <p>Players use teleporters by walking into the section of wall taken up by the teleport entrance.
                        They will then instantly arrive in a small exit room which players leave by walking towards the
                        door out of the room. This door is closed by default and can only be opened by players inside
                        the exit room walking up to it, at which point they will open automatically. Players outside the
                        exit room cannot open these doors, but they can be penetrated by gunfire.</p>
                    <p>Other objects can also be sent through teleporters if they come into contact with the teleporter
                        entrance. They will maintain any velocity they had before being teleported and can open the
                        doors and leave the exit room should they travel far enough to trigger the door sensor. Objects
                        include abilities, the spike, and dropped weapons.</p>
                    <p>Whenever a teleporter is used by an agent or an object, all players on the map will be given an
                        audio cue.</p>

                    <h1>Fracture</h1>
                    <p><i>A top secret research facility split apart by a failed radianite experiment. With defender
                            options as divided as the map, the choice is yours: meet the attackers on their own turf or
                            batten down the hatches to weather the assault.</i></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Fracture's unique design splits up the map into four neutral quadrants, four central areas
                        between the quadrants that contain the sites and Attacker spawns, and a central zone where
                        Defenders spawn. On Round Start, Defenders can access the sites, which are on opposite sides of
                        the map. Attackers all spawn in one area, but can reach the other side by using the cross-map
                        ziplines that take them underneath Defender Spawn. During the Buy Phase, Defenders are unable to
                        hear Attackers using the ziplines.</p>
                    <p>Each quadrant contains one orb, meaning Fracture has a total of four orbs as opposed to the usual
                        total of two orbs that are present on most other maps.</p>
                    <p>A Hall contains an automatic door that works similarly to the exit room doors for Bind's
                        teleporters, as it will instantly open once a player gets close enough, making a loud audio cue
                        as it does, and will also open for any abilities thrown towards it. This door on Fracture
                        however will also open for entities on both sides of the door.</p>

                        with colored indicators on them implying how much health they have left (starts blue, then turns
                        yellow and then red as they take more damage). They can eventually be destroyed to allow players
                        to wallbang through these doors for the rest of the round.</p>

                    <p>Pearl is a two-site three-lane map. Following on from the release of more strategically complex
                        maps like Icebox, Breeze, and Fracture, Pearl is designed as a more traditional map. As a
                        result, Pearl is the first map to be released that does not contain any dynamic elements or
                        mechanical hooks for gameplay.</p>

                                    Portuguese coast of Omega Earth. As the state of Omega's climate verges on the brink
                                    of collapse, the city of Lisbon faced destructive rising tides on course to
                                    completely submerge it below the ocean. To save the city and its people, the
                                    VALORANT Legion and Kingdom Industries worked together to keep the tides at bay and
                                    construct the geo-domes. Though the Atlantic inevitably rose far above, the
                                    completion of the geo-domes has ensured parts of Lisbon have still survived and its

                        One that allows players to get up from B Hell to B Tower.

                                    seek to take it back from them.</h6>
