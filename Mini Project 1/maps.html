                    <h1>Ascent</h1>
                    <p><i>San Marco, Venice, Veneto, Italy, Alpha Earth</i></p>
                    <p>45°26'BF" N 12°20'Q" E (45°26'15" N 12°20'9" E)</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ascent is a map set in Italy that features a large, open middle area that both teams can skirmish
                        over. Mid is a playground for diverse ability use and successfully controlling the area opens
                        additional routes for Attackers to both Spike sites.</p>
                    <p>The map's 'unique' features include mechanical doors leading into sites. Each site has one door
                        (A Link for A and Market for B) that is opened at the start of each round. Players can use a
                        switch on the site side of the door (Next to the door on A and on a table in Toolshed on B) to
                        close or open the door. These doors are impenetrable while closed but have 500 HP, allowing
                        players to damage and eventually destroy them. Once destroyed, the doorway remains permanently
                        open for the rest of the round.</p>
                    <p>The two walls separating Courtyard from Link also have a destructible panel each to cover them.
                        Whilst intact, they absorb damage and cannot be penetrated by gunfire. The panels however have
                        400 HP each and can be damaged, with colored indicators on them implying how much health they
                        have left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as they take more damage). They can
                        eventually be destroyed to allow players to wallbang through these walls for the rest of the
                        round.</p>

                                    the VALORANT Protocol failing to stop them, the resulting explosion triggered a

                    <p>Bind's 'unique' feature is that it doesn't contain a mid section, instead having two one-way
                        teleporters. One takes players from A Short to B Short and the other takes players from B Long
                        to A Lobby.</p>
                    <p>Players use teleporters by walking into the section of wall taken up by the teleport entrance.
                        They will then instantly arrive in a small exit room which players leave by walking towards the
                        door out of the room. This door is closed by default and can only be opened by players inside
                        the exit room walking up to it, at which point they will open automatically. Players outside the
                        exit room cannot open these doors, but they can be penetrated by gunfire.</p>
                    <p>Other objects can also be sent through teleporters if they come into contact with the teleporter
                        entrance. They will maintain any velocity they had before being teleported and can open the
                        doors and leave the exit room should they travel far enough to trigger the door sensor. Objects
                        include abilities, the spike, and dropped weapons.</p>
                    <p>Whenever a teleporter is used by an agent or an object, all players on the map will be given an
                        audio cue.</p>

                    <p>Fracture's unique design splits up the map into four neutral quadrants, four central areas
                        between the quadrants that contain the sites and Attacker spawns, and a central zone where
                        Defenders spawn. On Round Start, Defenders can access the sites, which are on opposite sides of
                        the map. Attackers all spawn in one area, but can reach the other side by using the cross-map
                        ziplines that take them underneath Defender Spawn. During the Buy Phase, Defenders are unable to
                        hear Attackers using the ziplines.</p>
                    <p>Each quadrant contains one orb, meaning Fracture has a total of four orbs as opposed to the usual
                        total of two orbs that are present on most other maps.</p>
                    <p>A Hall contains an automatic door that works similarly to the exit room doors for Bind's
                        teleporters, as it will instantly open once a player gets close enough, making a loud audio cue
                        as it does, and will also open for any abilities thrown towards it. This door on Fracture
                        however will also open for entities on both sides of the door.</p>

                    <p>Icebox is the first map to introduce horizontal ziplines, seen at the A Site. Each Icebox site is
                        a complex combat space that features plenty of cover and verticality. This map emphasizes
                        skirmishes, sharp aim, and adaptive play.</p>
                    <p>It is also the first map where the plant site has different levels of elevation. Both sites
                        contain nests that players can get into using ropes and then plant the spike on the nest floor.

                    <p>Pearl is a two-site three-lane map. Following on from the release of more strategically complex
                        maps like Icebox, Breeze, and Fracture, Pearl is designed as a more traditional map. As a
                        result, Pearl is the first map to be released that does not contain any dynamic elements or
                        mechanical hooks for gameplay.</p>
